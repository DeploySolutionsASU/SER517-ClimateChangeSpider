*Case Study:*
As we are doing big data processing in a stateless, non time-sensitive, fault-tolerant fashion there is no
hard requirement for us to have a server allocated for our project continuously(at all times) for the downloading/cleaning phase.


*what is an EC2 spot instance?*
Spot instances are unused EC2 instances in the Amazon Cloud. Since they are unused Amazon is giving those instance at a reduced cost.


*How EC2 spot instances work?*
Spot instances are allocated dynamically by Amazon based on the availablilty. Those instances can also be reclaimed by Amazon with a 
2 minute warning. 

*Benefits:*
EC2 spot instances are 90% cheap when compared to the on-demand EC2 instance.
Comes with all the integration options such as Auto Scaling, EMR and ECS.
